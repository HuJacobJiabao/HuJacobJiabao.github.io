# Who am I
Hello, welcome to my blog! I am Jiabao Hu, a junior CEE student at ZJU-UIUC Institute.:blush:

I am currently interested in intelligent transportation system:car:, machine learning:computer:, and modeling by blender-python API.

I am a big fan of classical music and also other kinds of music:musical_note:. The song list can be find on my [Netease Cloud Music personal page](https://music.163.com/#/user/home?id=31302645). If you like my music lists, don't hesitate to comment and subscribe:point_up_2:. 

In my spare time, I also try to compose some simple songs, which can be found on my [musician page](https://music.163.com/#/artist?id=35422348):musical_keyboard:.

This blog is for sharing ideas when I am learning something, such as algorithm, JavaScript, Music Theory as well as other courses' notes.
